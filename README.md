Collaborative Multi-User Code Editor

A real-time collaborative code editor that allows multiple users to write and view code simultaneously, with dynamic permission control. Built using modern web technologies and WebSockets for seamless live interaction.


1.  Objectives
Enable real-time collaborative editing for multiple users.

Implement live updates across all connected clients using WebSockets.

Create a host-controlled permission system to manage write access securely.

Maintain session consistency and prevent conflicting edits during collaboration.


2.  Technologies Used
Frontend: React, HTML/CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Real-Time Communication: WebSockets (Socket.IO)

State Management: React Hooks and Context API

Deployment (optional): Docker, AWS EC2 or Vercel/Heroku


3.  Key Features
 Live Code Editing: Changes by one user instantly appear for all others.

 Multi-User Support: Multiple users can join the same room to collaborate.

 Permission System: The host has full control to grant or revoke write access.

 Session Consistency: Ensures only one writer at a time to avoid conflicts.

 Room Sharing: Users can join shared rooms via invite code or link.
